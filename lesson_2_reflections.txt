What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	An empty repository is created in the working directory. Need to commit to save current work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is a place to store selected files before commit. It allow to commit on logically related multiple files at a time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
