When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	To collaborate with other people online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Your current work might not be ready to be shared at this point. For example, if you are in a process of creating a new feature you may want to wait until the feature is finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks: This is a way to copy a repository to your GitHub. You may use this when you want to have another version without changing the original repository.
	Clones: By git clone, you can copy a repository to your computer from the same machine or GitHub.
	Branches: Branches are labels for commits. You can have multiple branches other than master branch in a repository for experiments or various versions.
