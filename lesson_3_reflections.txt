When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	To collaborate with other people online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Your current work might not be ready to be shared at this point. For example, if you are in a process of creating a new feature you may want to wait until the feature is finished.
