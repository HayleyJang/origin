How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped me save time on looking for the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can find out mistakes that I make repeatedly and correct them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I may feel like autosaving is easier at first and less risky not to lose the work I'
    worked on. But for a long term period, having a history of a file can save
    lots of time and effort as the file gets bigger.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

could break something?

    Pros: every commit has meaningful checkpoint and able to avoid to much commits
    when you're not making much changes
    Cons: since it's a judgement call,

    Useful to track all interrelated files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lets you view the previous history with each associated id, and git
    diff shows you the changes (additions and deletions) when the two ids you
    want to compare are entered.

could break something?

    No need to worry about breaking something as far as you make sure commit!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To store my work history
